1. It prints 3. The code has console.log(i). This means print i. i is initialized as 0 at the beginning of the for loop. The for loop keeps adding 1 to while i is less than 3 (because 3 is the length of the prices array). So, i will become 3; the for loop becauses i is no longer less than 3. 
2. It prints 150. The code has console.log(discountedPrice). This means print discountedPrice. discountedPrice is initialized as a value in the prices array multiplied by 1 minus discount. discount is initialized as 0.5. Therefore, because we are iterating through the array from left to right, we would end up multiplying the last or rightmost value in the array by 0.5. The last value is 300, so we output 300 * 0.5 or 150. 
3. It prints 150. The code has console.log(finalPrice). This means print finalPrice. finalPrice is initialized as as the rounded result of multiplying discountedPrice by 100 and then dividing by 100. So, if we multiply and divide by 100 and then round, we still get 150. 
4. [50, 100, 150]. The code returns discounted. discounted is an array. We add each value of finalPrice to the array as we go through the for loop (this is due to the line discounted.push(finalPrice)). finalPrice is generated from multiplying discountedPrice by 100, dividing by 100, and then rounding. discountedPrice is generated by multiplying each value in the prices array by 0.5. Thus, [100, 200, 300] gives us [50, 100, 150]. 
5. ReferenceError; this is because line 12 tried to print the variable discountedPrice. However, this variable is of type let and is initialized inside the for loop. It cannot be accessed outside the for loop. 
6. ReferenceError; this is because line 13 tried to print the variable i. However, this variable is of type let and is initialized inside the for loop. It cannot be accessed outside the for loop. 
7. It will print 150; The code has console.log(discountedPrice). This means print discountedPrice. discountedPrice is initialized as a value in the prices array multiplied by 1 minus discount. discount is initialized as 0.5. Therefore, because we are iterating through the array from left to right, we would end up multiplying the last or rightmost value in the array by 0.5. The last value is 300, so we output 300 * 0.5 or 150. 
8. [50, 100, 150]; The code returns discounted. discounted is an array. We add each value of finalPrice to the array as we go through the for loop (this is due to the line discounted.push(finalPrice)). finalPrice is generated from multiplying discountedPrice by 100, dividing by 100, and then rounding. discountedPrice is generated by multiplying each value in the prices array by 0.5. Thus, [100, 200, 300] gives us [50, 100, 150]. 
9. ReferenceError; this is because line 11 tried to print the variable i. However, this variable is of type let and is initialized inside the for loop. It cannot be accessed outside the for loop. 
10. It will print 3 because line 12 says console.log(length). This is because the length of the prices array is 3, and in line 4, the variable length is initalized as prices.length.
11. [50, 100, 150]; The code returns discounted. discounted is an array. We add each value of finalPrice to the array as we go through the for loop (this is due to the line discounted.push(finalPrice)). finalPrice is generated from multiplying discountedPrice by 100, dividing by 100, and then rounding. discountedPrice is generated by multiplying each value in the prices array by 0.5. Thus, [100, 200, 300] gives us [50, 100, 150].
